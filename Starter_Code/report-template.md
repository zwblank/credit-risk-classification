## Overview of the Analysis

Lending companies give money or assets to borrowers, expecting them to return it. Credit Risk is the chance that borrowers won't return the assets or repay the loan, causing financial loss for the lender. Using Machine Learning, we can analyze past lending data to predict which borrowers are likely to repay their loans. 

I used a Logistic Regression Model on a dataset from a peer-to-peer lending company, achieving a 95% accuracy rate. However, the model's ability to identify non-healthy loans was less precise due to an imbalance in the dataset, where healthy loans were much more common.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Logistic Regression Model:
    * The Logistic Regression model trained on the given dataset accurately classified healthy loans 100% of the time but had an 85% accuracy in predicting non-healthy loans.
    * The imbalance of healthy vs non-healthy loan data can lead to mistakes such as classifying non-healthy loans as healthy loans.

## Summary

The Logistic Regression model using the given dataset performed well but could ultimately lead to inaccurate classifications.
